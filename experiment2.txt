Experiment 2 - mcts_modified vs mcts_vanilla
By Jonathan Lewis and Adam Carter

Game 1:
    1000 Nodes each over 20 games:
        Draws    = 1
        Modified = 13 - Winner
        Vanilla  = 6

Game 2:
    1000 Nodes each over 20 games: (repeating to make sure it wasn't a fluke)
        Draws    = 0
        Modified = 13 - Winner
        Vanilla  = 7

Game 3:
    100 Nodes each over 20 games: (reduced tree size)
        Draws    = 0
        Modified = 7
        Vanilla  = 13 - Winner

Game 4:
    100 Nodes each over 20 games: (reduced tree size and repeating to make sure wasn't a fluke)
        Draws    = 0
        Modified = 12 - Winner
        Vanilla  = 8

Game 5:
    100 Nodes each over 20 games: (score is 1-1 so deciding game)
        Draws    = 0
        Modified = 11 - Winner
        Vanilla  = 9

Analysis:

At 1000 nodes, it would appear that our mcts_modified wins out over mcts_vanilla majority of the time.
I feel confident about this result as both times modified won with 13 of the 20 possible games with
little to no variation.
Things started changing however when we reduced the tree size/node count.  At 100 Nodes, the 2
trees started struggling to win over the other.  I think modified would still win most of the time
due to the nature of it looking ahead, but sometimes it cannot just see enough moves and so the randomness
of the vanilla tree can win out from under it.
